## The story

So three years ago, I was a fresh graduate, the job market was tough (or at least I think it was), I was lucky enough to land a job at a small startup as a frontend developer. The first few months were exciting, I was learning a lot of new things, I worked hard, stayed late. I was proud of the quality of the code I wrote. I was proud of the UX problems that I devised solution and convinced the team to let me to implement it. I was proud that I can discover the root cause of a bugs well hidden beneath the core of the frontend.

And, here, after three years, I am still doing the same things.

> If you're not improving, you're degrading.

It wasn't that I wasn't learning new things. I was learning Flutter, backend development, engaging on UX and I was making the precursor of this actual blog _(which I axed, you can still find it in the repo of the blog if you really want to, it was really just a demo though)_. I also thought that maybe that I was not cutout for software engineering, so I did start on lots of hobbies, going through my root of photography, video editing, even plastic modeling.

The things is, although I was enjoying those, I never ended up doing anything more, I was just buying more, consume more and never really create anything. This feeling of dread never left me, until recently, when the meaning of the word "outcome", enter my vocabulary.

> I was focusing on output, not outcome.

## The terminology

- **Output**:
  - The number of things that you do.
  - The quality of the code that you write.
  - The number of features that you implement.
  - The bugs that you fix.

- **Outcome**:
  - The impact that your work has on the users.
  - The value that your work brings to the company.
  - The satisfaction that you get from your work.
  - The growth that you experience from your work.

## The traps

### The traps for people with the craftsmanship mindset

The people with the craftmanship mindset will try to improve the quality of things, believing it will give values. This is the trap that I was, and still occasionally am, guilty of.

Imagine that you were assigned to build a feature that only a small percentage of users will use, and the feature itself is not really that useful. Let's assign value of it is 1% as an example. It takes you 1 month, and you were fully focused on delivering the best quality code, with the best UX, and you were proud of it. You improved the feature's value by 50%.

> 50% of 1% is only 0.5%.
>
> You was proud of turnning a 1% feature into a 1.5% feature.

And I don't mean to discourage you from honing your craft. If you focus on features that a value of 10%, you can probably make it 15% with this mindset. **Focus on things that matter more.**

### The traps for high productivity people

If you look at the above example and think "Why don't you do the 1% feature faster?", yeah well, you are right. I think that this is generally the better approach for the 1% features. But at what cost?

1. You may deliver the feature faster, but it might _not be the best solution for the users_.
2. You might skip over some core problems because it seems so hard and so slow to resolve, problems and debt pile up. _Those slow you down in the long run._
3. You might miss out on opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. _You do so much, but it gives you no sense of value._ You ended up with a feature creep mess, losing sight of what your users really need.
4. You might end up with lots of these tiny little bugs, which will frustrate the users. And the one who deliver the feature - yes - **you will look bad.**
5. If you are a manager, and you make your people feel the above things for long enough, it will burn them out. They will inevitably hate you for it.

You might think that you are doing a great job, but in reality, you are still churning out code and features that don't really matter. Your product becomes a feature creep monster, and your users are frustrated. Your team is burnt out, and you are constantly firefighting bugs and issues.

### The traps for the outcome oriented

If you notice the pattern of the above two traps, yeah, it is about focusing on these things that only have the value of 1% instead of the things that bring 10-20% value. You are too focused on these details, you forget of the big picture - the impact, the value, the growth - **the outcome**.

If you have reached the point where you are outcome oriented, congratulations, you have escaped the output traps. But be careful, because there are still traps that you can fall into:

1. You forget about the output, **the process**. You become a dreamer, you dream of the big picture, but you never actually do anything to make it happen. To get the outcome of 10%, you need to do 10 small things that gives 1%. You need to do the work patiently, oh, and make sure you don't rush it.
2. You have outcome expectation,* The goals will be so glorious, you said. *But are your outcome expectations realistic? Where are these 10-20% numbers coming from? Are they based on data, or just your wishful thinking? You become too arrogant, you don't borther to verify your data, you don't checkout what your competitors are doing, you don't know why they success and their weaknesses are. Inevitably, you set yourself up for failure.
3. You forget about the working with you and most important person - **yourself**. Others are slow, that is their fault, it's because of them that is slowing you down. If they are slow, fine, guess you will be doing it yourself then. A workaholic dictator, you want everything to be done _your way_, you never actually listen to others. Instead of helping people grow and discover their value, you make them feel worthless. And you? A miserable person, too tired because everything is on your shoulder, your outcome waning to be achieved, but you are too exhausted to actually do anything.

## The way out

So, how to escape these traps? I don't have an easy answer yet, but here are some things that I am trying to do:

1. Focus on the outcome, not the output. Reflect on your work regularly. Are you focusing on the right things? Did the team improve or just playing the blame game? Are you making progress towards the outcome? - This is exactly why Scrum has the retrospective and review meeting at the end of each sprint.
2. Don't waste time on features that deliver little value. Don't be afraid to say no to features that don't align with the goals, even if it is requested by the users, or even your CEO. Yeah, this will be hard actually, but you need to make sure that your stakeholders are on the same page on the product goals and outcome.
3. Take care of yourself and your team. Make sure everyone is happy in their life so they can contribute effectively. They can't help you achieve the outcome if they are miserable and distracted on their personal issues, or their burnout.
4. Be humble and open to feedback. You don't have all the answers, and you can always learn from others - your team, your communities, your users, your competitors.
5. Celebrate the small wins. Every step towards the outcome is a victory.

The list here may be too idealistic, but oh well, I guess I need to start with beautiful ideas first. Who in their right mind would be drawn in to take the first step of improving things if they were faced with the harsh reality of the world anyway?
